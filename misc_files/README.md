## "Korry" switch

The lighted square button used by many aircraft is manufactured by Korry Inc, and the real switches are 
very high quality but also very very expensive. This is an attempt to replicate the pushbutton variant 
(non-latching) [Korry 389](https://www.korry.com/Content/SiteDocuments/389%20Switch_Technical%20Guide.pdf) 
with a Multimec 3FTH9 tactical pushbutton, two 3mm leds and a 3d printed cap that uses a laser-cut, painted & engraved
top "lens" as the legend. The white text can be made visible with a blob white nail gel on the back side that 
works nicely as a light diffuser for the text too.

#### The finished button:

#### The 3d printed part and the square "lens":

The button and leds work great on the 0.1" / 2.54mm hole pattern.
