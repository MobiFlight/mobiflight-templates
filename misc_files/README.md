## "Korry" switch

The lighted square button used by many aircraft is manufactured by Korry Inc, and the real switches are 
very high quality but also very very expensive. This is an attempt to replicate the pushbutton variant 
(non-latching) [Korry 389](https://www.korry.com/Content/SiteDocuments/389%20Switch_Technical%20Guide.pdf) 
with a [Multimec 3FTH9 tactical pushbutton](https://www.mouser.fi/ProductDetail/Apem/3FTH9?qs=tV%252Bq0wi8hA9t0vVgD0vepQ==) 
(link to mouser.com), two 3mm leds and a 3d printed cap that uses a laser-cut, painted & engraved
top "lens" as the legend. The white text can be made visible with a blob white nail gel on the back side that 
works nicely as a light diffuser for the text too.

The particular pushbutton in question is not necessarily the best for this job, but since it can accomondate 
a 3mm LED both in its center for a single led backlit pushbutton, and two leds on sides for a dual led "Korry" 
construction, it is a nice one to use for a lot of things - and seems to do the job quite nicely.  
It's not as cheap as the chinese pushbuttons, but it has a very good click feel and if you use it for many
panels, the price goes down if you buy a larger bag of them.

#### The 3d printed part and the square "lens":

The button and leds work great on the 0.1" / 2.54mm hole pattern.

The dual concentric encoder is the Alps EC11EBB24C03 that you can also find from Aliexpress (perhaps cloned) or 
from other places. In this folder are two STL files for a knob set for 3d printing that seem to work. Printed 
on an Ender 3 they fit ok once you clean up any first layer "elephants foot" on the holes with a hobby knife, 
the fit is quite tight and seems to work without any set screws.
