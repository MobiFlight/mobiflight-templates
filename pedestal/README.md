# Pedestal

### Because you need something to hold your simulator controls when you fly the sim.

This is a simple side console that can sit next to you, and where you can mount your panels
and have the usb hub, extension cord, and your wiring nicely contained within.

The pedestal is intended to be cut with a large size CO2 laser, out of 9mm MDF sheet. 
Many hackerspaces in the maker community have such machines available for members,
so that is one option worth checking out.

Construction is pretty simple once you get all the pieces cut. The big plates are the four walls, and the two 
C-shaped pieces form the bottom floor, and the small bars are "feet". The three holes are meant for screws
to position the feet in place under the floor pieces. Everything can be glued together with white PVA wood glue.

Once dry, you can lightly smooth the corners and edges with sandpaper to smoothen them out, and then paint
the whole thing with gray indoor paint, a paint roller works great. Use a small roller or brush for the rails
area.

Since obtaining or machining real DZUS mounting rails is considerably more difficult, the other svg file
contains laser cut rails that are to be made of 8mm plywood, and the holes are also cut with the
laser. While this is a joke of a mounting rail, in practice it works just fine if you use wood screws to 
mount your panels on the pedestal.

Test printing a few holes first and adjust hole size 
if needed to fit your screws to get a good grip without 
delaminating the plywood, as the holes are pretty close 
together.
