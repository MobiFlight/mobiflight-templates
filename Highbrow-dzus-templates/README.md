This is a set of templates sent by user Highbrow on the MobiFlight discord channel, it might also be useful in creating your own panel designs.

Note that these use Inkscape's "Path Effects" to add rounded corners on the plates, so you might want to convert these to path (Path -> Object to Path)  if you encounter
issues with the shapes changing, the fillet path effect can be a bit cranky sometimes.
