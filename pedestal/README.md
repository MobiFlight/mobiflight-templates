# Pedestal

### Because you need something to hold your panels when you fly.

This is a simple side console that can sit next to you, and where you can moutn your panels
and have the usb hub, extension cord, and your wiring nicely contained.

It is intended to be cut with a large size CO2 laser, out of 9mm MDF. Many hackerspaces 
ave such machines, so that is one option perhaps worth checking out.

Construction is pretty simple once you get all the pieces cut. The big plates are the four walls, and the two 
C-shaped pieces form the bottom floor, and the small bars are "feet". The three holes are meant for screws
to hold the feet in place. Everything else can be just glued with white PVA wood glue.

Since obtaining or machining real DZUS mounting rails is considerably more difficult, the other svg file
contains laser cut rails that are to be made of 8mm plywood, and the holes are also cut with the
laser. While this is a joke of a mounting rail, in practice it works just fine if you use wood screws to 
mount your panels on the pedestal.
